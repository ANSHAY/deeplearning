B: Yes, I do.

A: I haven't told you what happened yet, have I?

B: I haven't heard anything.

A: My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it.

B: Are you serious?

A: Yes, I am really excited.

B: That's great. Congratulations.

A: I appreciate that.

B: You have no idea how happy I am for you.

A: For real?

B: I believe you were the best choice for that promotion. I really do.
A: Why weren't you at school yesterday?

B: I wasn't really feeling well.

A: What was wrong with you?

B: My stomach was upset.

A: Do you feel better now?

B: I don't really feel too well yet.

A: Do you want anything to make you feel better?

B: No, thanks. I already took some medicine.

A: I hope you feel better.

B: Thank you.

A: What reason do you have for missing school?

B: I was sick.

A: How were you sick?

B: I had a stomachache.

A: Did it get any better?

B: I'm still feeling under the weather.

A: Would you like anything for your stomach?

B: I took something earlier.

A: Get better.

B: Thanks a lot.

A: Why didn't you go to school yesterday?

B: I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.

A: What was your problem?

B: My stomach was bothering me.

A: Are you feeling any better?

B: I'm still feeling a little sick.

A: I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?

B: That's okay.

A: I hope you feel better.

B: I'd appreciate that.
A: Have you seen the new girl in school?

B: No, I haven't.

A: She's really pretty.

B: Describe her to me.

A: She's not too tall.

B: Well, how tall is she?

A: She's about five feet even.

B: What does she look like, though?

A: She has pretty light brown eyes.

B: I may know which girl you're talking about.

A: So you have seen her around?

B: Yes, I have.

A: There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?

B: I haven't seen her yet.

A: I think that she is very pretty.

B: Tell me how she looks.

A: She's kind of short.

B: What height is she?

A: She's probably about five feet.

B: That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.

A: The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.

B: I think I might've bumped into her before.

A: Are you telling me that you've seen her before?

B: I believe so.

A: Have you met the new girl?

B: No. Have you?

A: She's one of the prettiest girls at the school.

B: What does she look like?

A: Well, she's quite short.

B: How tall would you say that she is?

A: I would say she's only five feet.

B: What about her facial features?

A: She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.

B: I think I know who you're talking about.

A: Have you seen her?

B: I think that I have.
A: Hello, may I speak to Alice please?

B: This is she. How's it going?

A: I've been trying to call you all day.

B: Sorry about that. I was cleaning up.

A: It's okay.

B: So what were you calling me about?

A: Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.

B: Sure, what did you want to do?

A: Maybe we can go see a movie or something.

B: That sounds like fun. Let's do it.

A: I'll see you tomorrow then.

B: See you then. Goodbye.

A: Hi, how are you. Is Alice there?

B: Speaking. What's up?

A: Why haven't you answered the phone?

B: My bad, I had chores to do.

A: That's all right.

B: What was the reason for your call?

A: I want to do something tomorrow with you.

B: Sounds good. What did you have in mind?

A: I was thinking about seeing a movie.

B: Okay, let's go see a movie.

A: Until then.

B: Talk to you later.

A: Is Alice available?

B: You're talking to her.

A: I've called you a hundred times today.

B: I was busy doing something. I apologize.

A: No problem.

B: Did you need something?

A: Do you want to do something tomorrow?

B: Is there somewhere special you wanted to go?

A: How about a movie?

B: A movie sounds good.

A: Call me tomorrow then.

B: I will see you tomorrow.
A: I really want to go to the beach this weekend.

B: That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?

A: I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.

B: Is it going to be perfect beach weather?

A: I believe so.

B: Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.

A: I know. I really want to go to the beach.

B: But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.

A: You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.

B: I really wish the weather would just stay the same.

A: I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.

B: Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.

A: I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.

B: A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?

A: The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.

B: So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?

A: It sounds like it will be.

B: I really hope it doesn't get cold.

A: That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.

B: The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.

A: That is true. The weather is constantly changing.

B: It would be nice if the weather would never change.

A: That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.

B: True. Predictable weather would make life easier.

A: It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.

B: What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too.

A: The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.

B: Will it be good beach weather?

A: I think it will be.

B: It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.

A: I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.

B: This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen.

A: I know. Every day the weather seems different.

B: I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.

A: That would make it easier for us to make plans.

B: I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.
A: It's such a nice day.

B: Yes, it is.

A: It looks like it may rain soon.

B: Yes, and I hope that it does.

A: Why is that?

B: I really love how rain clears the air.

A: Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.

B: Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.

A: Really? Why is it?

B: Because you can see the stars perfectly.

A: I really hope it rains today.

B: Yeah, me too.

A: Isn't it a nice day?

B: It really is.

A: It seems that it may rain today.

B: Hopefully it will.

A: How come?

B: I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.

A: I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains.

B: I especially love the night air when it rains.

A: Really? Why?

B: The stars look so much closer after it rains.

A: I really want it to rain today.

B: Yeah, so do I.

A: Don't you think it's nice out?

B: Yes, I think so too.

A: I think that it's going to rain.

B: I hope that it does rain.

A: You like the rain?

B: The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.

A: I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner.

B: I love most how it is at night after it rains.

A: How come?

B: You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.

A: I would love for it to rain today.

B: I would too.
A: It's an ugly day today.

B: I know. I think it may rain.

A: It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.

B: That would be weird.

A: Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.

B: I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.

A: Yes, it would be. 

B: I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 

A: Me too. I can't wait until winter.

B: I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.

A: I'd rather be cold than hot.

B: Me too.

A: It doesn't look very nice outside today.

B: You're right. I think it's going to rain later.

A: In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.

B: That wouldn't seem right.

A: Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.

B: Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.

A: I know, you're absolutely right.

B: I wish it would cool off one day.

A: That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.

B: I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.

A: I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.

B: That's exactly how I feel.

A: I wish it was a nicer day today.

B: That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.

A: It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.

B: It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.

A: It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.

B: Any rain right now would be pointless.

A: That's right, it really would be.

B: I want it to cool down some.

A: I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.

B: Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.

A: I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.

B: I feel the same way.
A: Hello, I need to register for a class.

B: What class are you trying to take?

A: I want to take a Psychology class.

B: Well, there are only two classes open.

A: Can you tell me what days the classes are on?

B: One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.

A: Are you sure there are no more open classes?

B: I'm positive.

A: Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.

B: Okay, I'll sign you up.


3
 Repeat

A: Could you help me to register for a class?

B: Do you know what class you want to take?

A: Are there any Psych classes available?

B: I believe there are still two Psychology classes open.

A: On what days are the classes?

B: There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4.

A: Can you tell me about the other class?

B: It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday.

A: You're positive that these are the only classes left?

B: These two are the only ones.

A: The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine.

B: Very good.
A: Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?

B: First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?

A: I was there too long.

B: Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?

A: Yeah, I saw it.

B: You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.

A: Yeah, I understand.

B: Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.

A: Yeah, you're right.

B: Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.

A: OK, I will.

B: Good luck!


2
 Repeat

A: Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?

B: Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?

A: I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.

B: Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?

A: I could tell what I was supposed to do.

B: That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help you out. 

A: I guess not.

B: Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.

A: Sure, if it will help.

B: Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.

A: Sounds good!

B: Give it your best shot; it might work.


3
 Repeat

A: I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.

B: Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you weren't supposed to be?

A: Both.

B: Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?

A: I was confused.

B: Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?

A: If it might work, I'll go for it!

B: Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it again.

A: I can see how that might work.

B: Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!

A: I could do that!

B: Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.
A: Can you tell me where I can park? 

B: Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?

A: I drive an automobile.

B: Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know what a handicapped space is?

A: Yes, I have seen those spots.

B: Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or evening?

A: I park in the evenings.

B: Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?

A: Yes, I have seen those signs.

B: The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?

A: Yes, I know what the curb colors mean.

B: Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know.


2
 Repeat

A: Where should I park?

B: Do you have a car or motorbike?

A: I drive a scooter

B: In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots?

A: No, I haven't seen those spots.

B: The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or night?

A: I park in the daytime. 

B: Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. Have you noticed those signs?

A: No, I have not seen the signs.

B: Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there. Do you know what the curb colors mean?

A: No, I don't know what the curb colors mean.

B: Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only. I think you'll be good to go!


3
 Repeat

A: What is the best place to park?

B: What vehicle do you usually bring to school? Is it an automobile or a motorbike?

A: I drive a motorcycle.

B: OK. That means you can park in the student lot or on the street. Have you seen the handicapped spots?

A: I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.

B: Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening?

A: I park days and evenings.

B: Be careful about the time limits on the streets. Have you seen the signs for time limits?

A: What signs?

B: As long as you are careful reading the signs, you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there. Are you aware of the curb colors?

A: What curb colors?

B: If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload, you are going to be OK.
A: I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester.

B: Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?

A: I am a daytime student.

B: Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?

A: I will be driving my car.

B: OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?

A: I'll pay for it with a check.

B: Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?

A: No, thanks; I'm fine.

B: Here you go then. Have a great school year!


2
 Repeat

A: I'll need a parking permit for next semester.

B: Do you attend school during the day or only at night?

A: I only attend class part-time in the evenings.

B: Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile? 

A: I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school.

B: Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?

A: I'll pay cash.

B: Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?

A: No, thank you.

B: OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester.


3
 Repeat

A: I want to buy a parking permit, please.

B: Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?

A: I attend both day and evening classes.

B: Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?

A: I ride a motorcycle.

B: That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?

A: I'll use a credit card, thank you.

B: Do you need a second permit for a car?

A: No, just the motorcycle permit.

B: Fine, here it is and have a great semester!
A: Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?

B: Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?

A: Yes, I understood the old one.

B: Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?

A: Debit or credit card.

B: OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?

A: Yes.

B: OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.

A: Yes, I can do that.

B: Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.

A: Yes, I'm ready.

B: All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.


2
 Repeat

A: Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?

B: It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?

A: I never used a parking meter before.

B: So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit card.

A: Cash.

B: Fine, can you read the rate on the display?

A: Yes, I can.

B: Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.

A: I'd rather not pay, but I have to.

B: Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move on, all right?

A: Perfect, let's do it.

B: Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.


3
 Repeat

A: This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?

B: It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.

A: Yeah, OK.

B: The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is it?

A: I have coins.

B: Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?

A: I didn't see that, but now I do.

B: Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.

A: Here it goes!

B: You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.

A: I am a little confused.

B: Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!
A: Can you help me with returning my late books?

B: This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.

A: OK, here they are.

B: I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty cents total.

A: OK, here's the money.

B: We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine. Does that make sense?

A: I'm not sure.

B: Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding fine.

A: Now I understand.

B: Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we are closed. Enjoy the library!


2
 Repeat

A: These books should have been turned in last week.

B: You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.

A: Here they are.

B: Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.

A: I don't have the money right now.

B: We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester. So you will be okay to go.

A: What would happen if I didn't pay it?

B: It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card and transcripts on time.

A: Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that.

B: Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you returning your books for all to use.


3
 Repeat

A: My library books are late, where can I put them?

B: This is where they need to be turned in. Let me see them to check the date, OK?

A: Yeah, I think that they are really late!

B: Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents.

A: What if I can't pay it?

B: We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before the end of the semester.

A: Yeah, I get it.

B: Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so always make sure that you do that.

A: That's not really fair!

B: If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside. Thanks for coming in!
A: Excuse me. I am interested in getting a library card.

B: Sure, let me give you an application. You can fill it out right here at the counter.

A: OK, here it is.

B: Let me take a look at this for you. May I have your driver's license, please?

A: Here's my license and form. 

B: You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?

A: Yes, I know what to do.

B: The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.

A: OK, I see.

B: Thank you for joining the library; we look forward to serving you.


2
 Repeat

A: I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card.

B: Of course, just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished.

A: I'm finished.

B: I will also need your driver's license; hand me the filled-out form, please.

A: OK, the form is all filled out.

B: Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?

A: No, I have no idea what they are.

B: Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.

A: Yes, right.

B: Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.


3
 Repeat

A: Good morning. Is this where I can get a library card issued to me?

B: No problem, we have a short form right here; just hand it to me when you are done.

A: I'm done.

B: That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I.D.

A: Sure, here it all is.

B: Well, this looks nice. Do you know how to use it?

A: I am pretty sure how to use it, but can you remind me?

B: Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.

A: I see.

B: Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!
A: Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?

B: Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?

A: I want to buy that candy.

B: OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready?

A: Yeah, so far, so good.

B: Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth.

A: Yeah, I already knew that.

B: I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it.

A: OK, let's move on!

B: Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or call the number on the side of the machine.

A: I hope it works!

B: Well, good luck!


2
 Repeat

A: I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help.

B: Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?

A: I want to buy a drink.

B: OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change. 

A: I've got the correct change already.

B: First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth.

A: OK, what next?

B: Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.

A: OK, next? 

B: Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.

A: I agree with you.

B: Hope that works for you!


3
 Repeat

A: I want to know how to buy something from this machine.

B: Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?

A: I want to buy one of those snack things.

B: Are you ready to go?

A: I'm clear so far.

B: The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.

A: It won't go in!

B: Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.

A: Yes, next step.

B: Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable.

A: They're totally unreliable.

B: You seem to have it down. Have a good day!
A: Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?

B: Sure! What kind of food would you like?

A: I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe.

B: I know the perfect place!

A: Good! Where is it?

B: It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?

A: That would be great.

B: Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!


2
 Repeat

A: Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?

B: Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?

A: Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great.

B: Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat.

A: Is it close by?

B: It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?

A: OK, I'd love the company.

B: This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.


3
 Repeat

A: Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?

B: I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?

A: Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something.

B: I have a great idea of where you might like to go.

A: Can we walk there?

B: It's on the second floor. May I join you?

A: Of course! Let's go.

B: Let's hurry. I'm starving!
A: When are we leaving for our field trip?

B: Our science field trip is next Monday at 8:00 in the morning. Can you mark that on your calendar?

A: Yes, I will write that down.

B: That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, so plan to arrive at 7:30.

A: Yes, I will be there on time.

B: We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?

A: Yes, someone is coming to get me.

B: The return bus will leave the campground at 5:00 p.m. and return to campus 3 hours later at 8:00 p.m.

A: What should we bring with us?

B: I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. Check it out when you get a chance. See you Monday!


2

B: That will be on the second of December. Be there ½ an hour early to get your bags on the bus. Do you understand?

A: Yes, I understand.

B: The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming to get you?

A: No, I don't have a ride yet.

B: We will be leaving the campground at 5:00 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8:00 p.m. Any more questions?

A: How much will the trip cost?

A: Yes, someone is picking me up.

B: To get back to campus by 8:00 p.m., we will be leaving the campsite at 5:00 p.m. Do you have any more questions?

A: Not at the momentmaybe later, though.

B: All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway. See you on Monday!
A: I am unsure how to add a class and need help.

B: I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?

A: Yes, I have an add sheet.

B: After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?

A: No, I'm not sure.

B: When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line.

A: Thanks. I understand what to do now.

B: It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.

A: That sounds good.

B: Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!


2
 Repeat

A: Professor, can you help me add your class?

B: You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?

A: No, I will have to get an add sheet.

B: You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?

A: No, I don't know where that is.

B: The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.

A: I think I can find it.

B: You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.

A: Thank you for letting me add your class.

B: To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!


3
 Repeat

A: I am not sure how to add a class.

B: Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? 

A: I'll bring one next time.

B: When you get the signed add slip, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added. Can you find the office?

A: I think I know where it is.

B: Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the correct line. Is that clear?

A: Thank you for your directions. It's clear.

B: You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet.

A: That's great. Thank you so much.

B: Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!
A: I have an appointment for 1:30.

B: What can I help you with?

A: Well, I have a problem with my class schedule.

B: What is it?

A: It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.

B: I can understand the problem with that.

A: Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?

B: No problem, do you want those classes still?

A: Yes, I do.

B: Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.

A: Thank you very much. 


2

B: I'll try to change one to a different day.

A: I would greatly appreciate that.


3
 Repeat

A: I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30.

B: Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?

A: There's a problem with my schedule.

B: What's the problem?

A: Two of my classes occur at the same time.

B: Well, I can see that's a problem.

A: Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?

B: Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?

A: I want to keep both of them, if that's possible.

B: Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day.

A: Thanks a lot.
A: Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today.

B: What is the problem?

A: I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative.

B: Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?

A: Yes, I've got that part covered.

B: When, exactly do you need to leave?

A: I don't need to leave until the very end of class.

B: Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?

A: Yes, it's all taken care of.

B: Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?

A: I can stay a few more minutes.

B: OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.

A: Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!

B: Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.


3
 Repeat

A: I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class.

B: Where do you need to be that is more important than school?

A: I have an appointment.

B: Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?

A: No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.

B: Are you going to go right away?

A: I am leaving right now.

B: All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.

A: Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.

B: Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school.
A: Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class.

B: Is this something that you could schedule for another time?

A: No, I have to do this; it's important!

B: Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?

A: I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.

B: You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?

A: Yes, I know.

B: Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.

A: OK, I can do that.

B: Well, have a good day off from class.


2
 Repeat

A: Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting.

B: Is this absolutely necessary?

A: I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class.

B: Will you be able to make up the work you missed?

A: I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.

B: Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.

A: Yes, I remember.

B: Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?

A: Sure, no problem.

B: Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!
A: I'd like to talk to you about my grades.

B: Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?

A: I am worried that I messed up on a test.

B: Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?

A: I think I am doing great, except for that one test!

B: Well, your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think you could improve on?

A: I think that I could study a little harder for tests.

B: Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.

A: Yes, I know.

B: I'm sure you'll do fine.


2
 Repeat

A: Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?

B: Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?

A: Am I failing?

B: Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?

A: I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.

B: I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?

A: I missed a few classes; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis.

B: Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?

A: I'll try; it's hard!

B: Thanks for stopping by!

3
 Repeat

A: Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?

B: Of course, how can I help you?

A: I want to know if I am doing OK.

B: Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?

A: I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.

B: I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others.

A: I think I could take better notes and read a little more.

B: You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.

A: I'm working on it!

B: Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
A: I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades.

B: Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and final.

A: What counts the most?

B: Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.

A: Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?

B: Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each.

A: What if we miss something?

B: I will allow one unexcused absence; after that you need to contact me ahead of time.

A: Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?

B: You will be able to track your progress during the year.


2
 Repeat

A: What do you base our grades on?

B: All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester.

A: Does the final count the most?

B: All of it is important; please just do your best at all times.

A: How do you total our scores?

B: The final and mid-term are twenty percent each; homework, attendance, and quizzes are the rest.

A: What if we are out sick?

B: Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.

A: How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?

B: Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on.


3
 Repeat

A: How do you decide what grade we get?

B: I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests.

A: What is the most important factor?

B: Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do your best from the beginning.

A: How can we keep track of our grades?

B: The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade; homework, attendance, and quizzes total 60 percent.

A: What if we can't get to school?

B: You can only miss one class without penalty.

A: If we have a major problem, will you let us know?

B: I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.
A: Do you have the notes from last week's class?

B: Did you come late?

A: I couldn't make it.

B: Why is that?

A: I was sick.

B: Oh, okay. Well, here you go.

A: Are these all of them?

B: Oh, wait, here are the rest.

A: Thanks a bunch.

B: Don't mention it.


2
 Repeat

A: Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?

B: Were you here last week?

A: I was unable to make it.

B: How come?

A: I was sick that day, and couldn't make it.

B: Well, here are the notes.

A: Are there any more?

B: Sorry, here you go.

A: Thanks a lot.

B: No problem.


3
 Repeat

A: Let me get last week's notes.

B: Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?

A: I couldn't come.

B: Why not?

A: I wasn't feeling well.

B: Here they are.

A: Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?

B: Oh, no, this is the rest.

A: Thank you very much.

B: It's no problem at all.
A: Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score.

B: Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right?

A: I think that the percentage is incorrect.

B: Let's just go over all of it to double-check.

A: Sure, let's do it.

B: Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?

A: I don't see any mistakes.

B: OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.

A: Yes, let's total it.

B: Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total. Do you agree?

A: Yes, you're right.

B: Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention.


2
 Repeat

A: I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.

B: Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?

A: I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.

B: These things can happen; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all right?

A: That would be great!

B: Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?

A: This one right here should be right.

B: Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?

A: Yeah, let's do the math.

B: I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does this look right to you?

A: Looks pretty good.

B: Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!


3
 Repeat

A: Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong.

B: What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?

A: Both.

B: I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too. Will that work for you?

A: Yeah, I'm ready.

B: Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake.

A: These look strange.

B: Yes, I agree; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be OK?

A: OK, let's do the calculation.

B: We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.

A: I see.

B: Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!
A: Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done.

B: What happened that you didn't get it done?

A: I had to watch a football game instead.

B: Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?

A: Yes, I think so.

B: Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?

A: I'll make it up next week.

B: Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an A in the class.

A: OK, I can do that.

B: Remember that you are in college now, not high school.


2
 Repeat

A: I don't have my homework today.

B: You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?

A: I was really sick.

B: But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?

A: Yes, I probably could.

B: You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?

A: Next class meeting.

B: That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, all right?

A: That would work for me.

B: Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.


3
 Repeat

A: Let me tell you what happened to my homework.

B: OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?

A: Actually, I did it, but then it got lost.

B: Could you have gotten it done at another time?

A: Yes, I could.

B: You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?

A: I'll make it up early next week.

B: That would work, but don't let it happen again.

A: I'll try.

B: That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
A: Professor, could I make an appointment with you?

B: I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four; do you have a particular time in mind? 

A: Two o'clock would be the best time.

B: Fine, do you know where my office is?

A: No, I'm not sure.

B: Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor.

A: I see.

B: Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then.

A: I'll see you then.

B: Looking forward to meeting with you!


2
 Repeat

A: Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you?

B: I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four; what time works out best?

A: I would like to come in at three o'clock.

B: I am glad that that works out; can you find my office?

A: Yes, I can.

B: Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor.

A: I got it.

B: If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way.

A: Thank you, I'll be there.

B: If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!


3
 Repeat

A: Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you?

B: I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday; what works best for you? 

A: Three would be a good time.

B: Great, do you need directions to my office?

A: I'm not sure.

B: Well, just make sure to go through the double doors, and I'll be on the right.

A: OK, I'll find it.

B: It's very easy to find.

A: See you then.

B: I will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!
A: Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller?

B: Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?

A: Yes, but I have never taken his class before.

B: He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?

A: Yes, that's what I need.

B: He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you willing to study hard?

A: Yes, I guess so.

B: What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?

A: Yes, I had a teacher like that before.

B: Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?

A: No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing.

B: Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good luck!


2
 Repeat

A: Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?

B: Yes. Are you in his class?

A: I'm thinking of taking his class next semester.

B: He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?

A: Yes, I really need someone who is really good.

B: I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that?

A: Maybe, but I'm not sure.

B: Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?

A: No, that stuff isn't important to me.

B: Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?

A: I don't care about any of that.

B: We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped you.


3
 Repeat

A: Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?

B: Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?

A: I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.

B: He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?

A: I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades.

B: Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too?

A: I really need to learn this stuff.

B: He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?

A: Yes, that sounds right for me.

B: Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?

A: Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing.

B: I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
A: How do I buy my textbooks?

B: Do you have your book list for your class?

A: Yes, I have my list.

B: Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?

A: Yes, I know where the bookstore is.

B: OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there? 

A: No, I didn't know I could do that.

B: You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be doing that today?

A: Yes, I am going today.

B: Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or tomorrow to help you. Would that work for you?

A: Really? How can I do that?

B: Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?

A: No, I can't make it today.

B: I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or tomorrow. Would you like my help?

A: No, thanks. I'm good.

B: I'll see you later then. Have a great day!

A: I am not sure where the bookstore is.

B: When you pass the gym, it'll be the first door on the left. Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money?

A: Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?

B: If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, he will reimburse you. Can you go over there today?

A: I think maybe I could be there.

A: Is the moving van here yet?

B: Yes, it just pulled up to the curb. Here we go! 

A: Could you double-check and make sure that everything made it into the boxes?

B: I have already done that. Would you like me to put our suitcases into the car?

A: Yes, this would be a good time to do that.

B: I am so glad that we took the time to pack our essentials into suitcases. It will tide us over until the van arrives at our new home.

A: Would this be a good time to pack the frozen food into the ice chest?

B: I think that we should wait until the very last minute to do that.

A: I am going to take the dog for a walk so that he doesn't get too stressed out as the movers are working.

B: Well, let's get started sweeping up and do a last minute cleaning.


2
 Repeat

A: Do you think that the moving van has arrived?

B: It's coming down the street even as we speak.

A: Could I ask you to make one last check to make sure that everything got into the boxes?

B: Relax. Do you need me to put the suitcases in the car?

A: Yes, let's do that right now. 

B: It was such a good idea to pack a suitcase to have some things with us while we are waiting for the moving van to arrive on the other end.

A: Maybe we could pack the frozen food into the ice chest?

B: Let's wait until the van is almost completely loaded to take care of that.

A: I am sure happy that we dropped the cats off at the kennel so they aren't freaking out.

B: I am going to start sweeping up the floor. I want the new owners to not have to clean up a mess.


3
 Repeat

A: Could you check and see if the moving van is out there yet?

B: It just arrived. They are parking at the curb right now.

A: Do me a favor and do one last walk-through to check for anything that may not have gotten packed.

B: We've already double-checked everything. Should we put the suitcases in the car?

A: It is the perfect time to take care of that.

B: I am so happy that we didn't pack all of our clothes into boxes. The suitcase of clothes will help us get to what we need until our boxes arrive.

A: Should we empty the freezer into the ice chest?

B: Let's do a few more things and then take care of that as one of the last things we do.

A: Deciding to keep the birds at the neighbors until we leave was a good idea.

B: Let's sweep the floor on our way out so we don't leave too big of a mess behind
A: Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home?

B: The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done. Then number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.

A: What kinds of things should be on my list?

B: First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by having a garage sale.

A: That is a good idea because I have way too much junk.

B: You also should schedule your moving van in advance.

A: Can I begin packing things ahead of time?

B: Yes, just keep in mind what you won't be using in the near future and pack those items first.

A: Should I schedule my utilities to be shut off?

B: You need to work that out ahead of time with your utility companies and the new owners.


2
 Repeat

A: I was wondering if you had any useful suggestions for how to prepare for our moving day.

B: Make a prioritized list of what needs to be done and when. Many things can be done ahead of time.

A: Can you give me some suggestions for my list?

B: Many people have a garage sale to avoid moving things that they no longer use.

A: That would certainly cut down on the price of moving.

B: Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.

A: Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing?

B: Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need. Save only a few things until right before your moving date.

A: When should I have my utilities shut off?

B: It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.


3
 Repeat

A: I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions.

B: I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along. The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.

A: What things do people usually put on their moving-out list?

B: One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by having a garage sale.

A: That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things.

B: List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.

A: Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving?

B: You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.

A: I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the people who are moving in.

B: You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.
A: I really need help knowing what to do about transferring the deed of my house.

B: The work of legally transferring the deed of your house will be taken care of in escrow.

A: What is the first thing that they will do?

B: The first thing they do is a title search to make sure that there are no liens against your property.

A: What if I have a lien against my property?

B: Your home cannot be sold until you clear all liens.

A: How long will the escrow take?

B: You can control some aspects of the length of your escrow but not all. Complete all paperwork in a timely fashion.

A: So, how many days will it take?

B: An escrow can take anywhere from thirty to ninety days.


2
 Repeat

A: I know nothing about transferring the deed of my home.

B: The escrow company will be doing all of the work in transferring your deed.

A: What is the first step in transferring the deed?

B: A deed transfer always includes a title search to make sure that there are no outstanding liens against the property.

A: What if they discover a lien against my property?

B: A title transfer cannot occur until you clear all liens.

A: Will my escrow take long?

B: To move your escrow along, it is important to supply all documents that are requested in a timely fashion.

A: What is the length of the average escrow?

B: The average escrow will last anywhere from thirty to ninety days.


3
 Repeat

A: I think that I am going to hire a lawyer to help me transfer the deed of my house.

B: Don't worry. The escrow company will be helping us with transferring the deed.

A: How do they begin the process of transferring the deed?

B: A title search is necessary to make sure that there are no liens against your property.

A: What will happen if they find a lien against my property?

B: All liens against the property must be cleared before the sale of your house can continue.

A: How can I shorten my escrow?

B: Make sure that you accurately complete all paperwork in a timely fashion. This will help shorten the length of your escrow.

A: How many days will it take to close the escrow?

B: Thirty to ninety days is about how long it takes to complete an escrow
A: I heard that the potential buyer is interested in me carrying part of a loan for him.

B: Carrying part of a loan can be a good or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances.

A: What would be an advantage of me carrying a note on the house?

B: If you don't need the money right away, you can earn a fairly good interest rate.

A: Why does my buyer want me to carry part of his loan?

B: In this economy, buyers sometimes have trouble getting a loan even when they have good credit.

A: What are the risks to me?

B: The risk is that the market could drop drastically and the owner would walk away.

A: How long will I need to commit to financing this loan?

B: You need to make an agreement with the buyer as to how long you will carry this note.


2
 Repeat

A: My potential buyer has asked me to carry part of his loan.

B: The decision to carry part of a loan might be advantageous to you or problematic.

A: Why would I ever want to carry a note on a house?

B: It is a type of investment that can offer a fairly steady return over a set period of time.

A: Why is my buyer requesting that I carry part of his loan?

B: Oftentimes buyers are well able to afford the home but unable to qualify for a loan.

A: Are there any risks in carrying a second mortgage?

B: You are basically betting on the fact that the home is not going to drastically fall in price. This could leave you with a house that is not worth much.

A: Will I be financing this loan for a set period of time?

B: That is entirely up to you and the buyer.


3
 Repeat

A: If the purchaser of your home wants you to carry part of the loan, is that good?

B: Carrying a loan could be good or bad for you as a seller.

A: Why would it be a good thing to carry a note on my own house?

B: For investors who can afford to have their money tied up, it can offer a fairly nice return.

A: What advantage is my buyer looking for in having me carry him on paper?

B: We are seeing more and more buyers who are not able to qualify for a loan and are able to take out a second mortgage with the owner.

A: Can I lose my money if I carry a second mortgage?

B: It is an investment and carries some risks. You are counting on the housing market to not go into a tailspin.

A: Is there a certain amount of time that I will be carrying this loan?

B: The buyer and seller set the year for the loan to come due
A: Your office called and left a message that several offers had come in on our home.

B: Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!

A: Were the offers for a good price?

B: One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.

A: Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!

B: Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the most money.

A: What other factors do I need to consider?

B: We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to purchase the house.

A: How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home?

B: We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.

A: When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision.

B: When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.


2
 Repeat

A: I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house.

B: It has been quite a busy day regarding your home. We just received three offers!

A: Did the potential buyers offer a good price?

B: There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly for the asking price.

A: The highest bid is always the best bid!

B: We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.

A: What things would you like me to look at?

B: Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have the credit to purchase the home.

A: How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home?

B: We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A large amount of available cash would be a good sign.

A: I will wait for that information and give you my answer.

B: Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the buyers.


3
 Repeat

A: My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home.

B: The Open House was quite a success. Last night we received three offers on your home!

A: I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received!

B: Offers above and below the asking price came in. One was right on the money.

A: Let's go with the highest bid!

B: We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.

A: What matters besides getting the money for the house?

B: We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even purchase a home.

A: I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.

B: We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home. This would make them more desirable. 

A: I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me.

B: Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.
A: I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer.

B: Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own.

A: Is the counteroffer close to the asking price?

B: The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.

A: I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing.

B: I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you should get a better price for it.

A: What should I do at this point?

B: Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are rejecting their latest offer.

A: Can you take care of that for me and get back to me?

B: I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you will accept.


2
 Repeat

A: Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my counteroffer?

B: Yes, I was going to call you this morning. Your buyers have responded with a counteroffer.

A: Is the counteroffer a good one?

B: They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.

A: That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go.

B: I think that your feelings are valid. You have a beautiful home and can afford to wait for a better offer.

A: What is the next step?

B: You can flat-out reject their offer and see what they come up with.

A: I would like you to notify them that I am rejecting their offer.

B: I will notify the buyers that you will not accept their counteroffer.


3
 Repeat

A: I was wondering if the buyers have accepted my counteroffer.

B: Yes, I just faxed you the information an hour ago. The buyers have a counteroffer for you.

A: How much did they counteroffer?

B: They now are offering to pay ten thousand less than your asking price.

A: I am not really ready to accept that low of a price.

B: I wouldn't accept that price either. Your home is in a good area and should command a higher price.

A: Where do we go from here?

B: We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer. They might choose to offer a higher price.

A: Please let the buyers know that I am rejecting their offer.

B: I will take care of that right away. They may or may not raise their offer
A: My assistant called and said that you had received a response to our counteroffer.

B: Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.

A: Did they accept the counteroffer?

B: They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you wanted.

A: What do you think about their offer?

B: I think that this is a good offer. They also would like to have a 90-day escrow to allow them to sell their home. 

A: The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us.

B: They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.

A: That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions.

B: I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer. They will be very pleased!


2
 Repeat

A: I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our counteroffer.

B: Yes, the response just came through on the fax machine.

A: Was the counteroffer acceptable to them?

B: They made their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you proposed.

A: Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable?

B: Their offer is a good one. They also want to have a short escrow as they have already sold their home and are ready to move in.

A: We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.

B: They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.

A: I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.

B: I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of their counteroffer. I am sure they will be excited!


3
 Repeat

A: I was calling in to see if there had been any response from the buyers regarding my counteroffer.

B: Yes, the buyer's agent just contacted me while I was at an Open House.

A: Did they state whether the counteroffer worked for them or not?

B: They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower. They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.

A: In your professional opinion, is this a good offer?

B: Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer. They also want a short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now. 

A: We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer.

B: They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major problems with the house before this is a solid deal.

A: Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept their counteroffer.

B: The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.
A: I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our house.

B: Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning.

A: Is the offer a good offer?

B: The offer is pretty good. You asked three hundred thousand and they offered two hundred eighty thousand.

A: I would be willing to take two hundred ninety thousand, but no lower.

B: You could make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Would you like to do that?

A: Yes, I would like to make the counteroffer.

B: I will make the counteroffer immediately by phone.

A: What if they don't accept the counteroffer?

B: They can make a counteroffer themselves or state that their first offer stands.


2
 Repeat

A: I got a message on my machine that you received an offer on my house.

B: Yes, the offer came in late last night. It was too late to call you.

A: Is the offer as high as we were hoping for?

B: They offered two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you were asking three hundred thousand dollars. They are definitely in the ballpark.

A: I was prepared to go a little lower, but more like two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

B: Would you like to make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars?

A: I definitely would like to make a counteroffer.

B: I will FAX them the counteroffer right away.

A: What if my counteroffer gets turned down?

B: They have an option of making a counteroffer, or they can just reject your counteroffer.


3
 Repeat

A: Your office called and said that an offer came in on our house.

B: Yes, the offer came in less than an hour ago.

A: How good of an offer did we receive?

B: Their bid was two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you said that you wanted three hundred thousand dollars. Their bid is a reasonable start.

A: We built a little leeway into the asking price, but I don't want to accept less than two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

B: Sellers frequently make a counteroffer. Would you like to counteroffer two hundred ninety thousand dollars?

A: I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point.

B: I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.

A: What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer?

B: If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or come up with a counteroffer of their own
A: So how much did the buyers bid on our house?

B: Your asking price was three hundred thousand dollars. The potential buyers offered two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

A: That's a great offer!

B: Yes, it is a good offer. Before you accept, we should look at some details.

A: What else do we need to look at?

B: They want you to pay all closing costs. Of course, they are making the sale contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house.

A: I think that that sounds fair.

B: You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their eye on another house down the street.

A: I definitely want to accept their offer.

B: Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.


2
 Repeat

A: I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house!

B: Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars. The first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

A: That's way better than I expected so early in the game!

B: The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole picture.

A: What are the other considerations?

B: They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the inspector. If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal.

A: I don't have a problem with that.

B: You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale.

A: Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer.

B: I think that you are making the right choice. I will phone the buyers right away!


3
 Repeat

A: What did the buyers offer us on our house?

B: With the original asking price at three hundred thousand dollars, the buyers are willing to pay two hundred ninety thousand dollars.

A: I am really pleased with that offer.

B: I agree that the offer is in the ballpark. We need to consider everything before you accept.

A: Besides the selling price, what else is there to consider?

B: They want you to pay to have the cracks in the back wall fixed and a couple of the roof tiles replaced.

A: All of that is acceptable to me.

B: A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close to your asking price. You could risk losing the sale.

A: I wish to officially accept their offer.

B: This is a win-win situation for both you and the buyer. I am sure that you will both be happy with your decision
A: What should I do to get ready for the Open House?

B: Your house needs to be as clean and uncluttered as possible.

B: We have two realtors to keep an eye on things at all times, but please don't keep valuable jewelry or guns in your home when it is being shown.

A: I am not so sure that everyone will like the landscaping.

B: Your lawn is a disaster! To get top dollar for your home, you should replace it.

A: Is there anything I can do to add some interest to my front yard?

B: We put a lockbox on your house. The realtors will have a key to the lockbox and then they can get a key to your front door.

A: What about people watching my stuff during an Open House?

B: We always suggest that you either store your jewelry in a safe or move it into a friend's house while your house is being shown.


2
 Repeat

A: I am worried about the security of my home while it is being shown.

B: We do everything we can to protect your home and your valuables

A: Do people just come and look whenever they want to?

B: During the week, we will let you know the night before if we will be bringing someone by the next day.

A: I am assuming that someone from your office will always be there, right?

B: Your home is listed exclusively with our office. We will be the only ones showing your home.

A: Does everyone have a copy of my house key?

B: Realtors have a special key to what is called a lockbox. Once they get into the lockbox, they can get a key to the house.

A: I have heard horror stories from friends about being ripped off during their Open House.

B: Our company has invested in several cameras that we place in the key rooms while the house is being shown.


3
 Repeat

A: I have heard horror stories about people's things being stolen while their house is being shown.

B: We have a very good track record when it comes to home security.

A: I am not so sure that I like the idea of people showing up whenever they want to pop in!

B: We will always call at least 12 hours in advance if we are bringing someone by to see your home.

A: Are you the only one showing my house?

B: To get maximum exposure and a variety of buyers, your home is listed on the multiple listing. Many different realtors will be showing your home.

A: Do you have to come and let the different realtors in when they come to look at my house?

B: The realtors can get a key to your house by unlocking a lockbox on your front door. They use it while they are there and return it when they leave.

A: The thing I worry about the most is having my valuables stolen during an Open House.

B: Our realtors try to be very aware at all times of who is in the house and what they are doing
A: So what do you think I should do to fix up the interior of my house?

B: A fresh coat of paint is the number one improvement that you can make to your home.

A: What colors do you think would be best?

B: You need to go with fairly neutral tones. You want fairly contemporary colors that will go with a variety of furnishings.

A: After paint, what is the next most important improvement that I can make?

B: Remove any extra furnishings and personal items. Make your home look as uncluttered as possible.

A: Should I get a new carpet?

B: Your carpet is in really good shape. New owners typically want to pick out their own carpeting.

A: How about improvements to the bathroom?

B: New faucets are not that expensive and can quickly add a clean and more up-to-date look.


2
 Repeat

A: What are your suggestions for some inexpensive fixes to help me get the best price for my home?

B: Painting the interior of your home is not that expensive and greatly improves the appearance of your home.

A: Should I go for trendy colors or more traditional tones?

B: You don't want to make any dramatic statements with paint, but don't go with just white either.

A: What else can I do besides paint the inside of my home to improve its value? 

B: You need to get rid of any extra furniture or knick-knacks.

A: I need to know if I should replace the carpeting.

B: Your carpeting is very worn. You might want to explore buying some attractive inexpensive carpeting.

A: How about improvements to the kitchen?

B: You could inexpensively replace the linoleum flooring; that would really brighten things up.


3
 Repeat

A: What do people usually do to improve the interior of their houses before they sell them?

B: Your house looks very nice on the inside, but a fresh coat of paint always helps brighten a home's interior.

A: I get confused when trying to pick out colors that other people might like.

B: Lighter neutral colors are usually best. They make rooms appear larger.

A: The painting suggestion is a good one, but after that, what improvement will add value to my home?

B: Your interior should have only the most basic of furniture. Either store or get rid of any extra clutter.

A: What about replacing the floor covering?

B: I know that your carpeting is not brand new, but with a good steam cleaning, I think that it will look great.

A: Is there anything that I can do to the bathrooms and kitchen that wouldn't cost too much?

B: New curtains or blinds do not cost that much and brighten up any room
A: My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract.

B: Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it.

A: How much does a lawyer cost?

B: I don't know. A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.

A: That can't be legal! 

B: Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.

A: Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that?

B: You'd have to check the yellow pages or go online.

A: There's no telling how many hours the lawyer will charge me for.

B: Also, it might take a week or two just to get an appointment.

A: I'd rather get this over with, so just show me where to sign.

B: Good man! I've marked all the places for you to sign and date.


2
 Repeat

A: My wife said to have a lawyer look at the contract.

B: That's always a good idea.

A: Do you know how much a lawyer runs?

B: I've heard that they're about $400 an hour.

A: Who can afford that?

B: A few years ago, $100 an hour was outrageous.

A: Can you help me find a cheaper lawyer?

B: I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

A: The lawyer will start at $400, but where will it end?

B: Also, a good lawyer might not have time to see you immediately.

A: My wife's going to kill me, but just show me where to sign.

B: Now you're talking. The red stickers indicate where to sign and date.


3
 Repeat

A: My wife told me to get a lawyer to review the contract first.

B: A smart husband always does what his wife tells him.

A: How much are lawyers charging nowadays?

B: It's hard to believe, but I think they charge about $400 an hour.

A: That's highway robbery!

B: I think lawyers are making twice what doctors are making.

A: Are there any lawyers that are cheaper than that?

B: The best advice I can give you is to Google it.

A: I can barely afford one hour, but certainly not two.

B: Remember, it might take a few days just to set up an appointment.

A: I really don't have the time or the money, so where do I sign?

B: Your wife will thank you. Just sign and date where the little red stickers are
A: How much do you think that I should ask for my house?

B: Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.

A: What do you look at when setting an asking price?

B: We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.

A: Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?

B: No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.

A: Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?

B: You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.

A: Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?

B: Sure, you can always lower your asking price.


2
 Repeat

A: I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.

B: We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.

A: What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?

B: The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth. 

A: Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home?

B: You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.

A: Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later?

B: You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.

A: Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?

B: We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.


3
 Repeat

A: What do you think the asking price of my home should be?

B: There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.

A: What is involved in figuring out an asking price?

B: We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.

A: When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?

B: You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.

A: I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.

B: Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.

A: Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers?

B: If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it
A: Thank you for coming to look at my house.

B: I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to do.

A: When will people come to look at my house?

B: Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private appointment.

A: Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your office?

B: Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have the maximum exposure to a variety of people.

A: Will I know when people are going to come see my house?

B: We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at least four hours of notification that someone is coming.

A: What happens during an Open House day?

B: You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the details.


2
 Repeat

A: I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.

B: It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we make sure that we are on the same page.

A: How do you show my home to potential buyers?

B: We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your home with private appointments during the week.

A: Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?

B: We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.

A: How will I know when to expect prospective buyers?

B: That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours notice.

A: Can I stay home during an Open House day?

B: The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle the showing of your home.


3
 Repeat

A: Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.

B: I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling a home.

A: When can people come and see my home?

B: We will have several Open House weekends. Various realtors will also show your house during the week.

A: Will I know all of the realtors who will be showing my home, or will they be strangers?

B: Your house will be listed on what we call a Multiple Listing. That way it will be shown by a variety of realtors.

A: Can people just drop in anytime they feel like it?

B: We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone is coming to look at your home.

A: Will I have to go away during an Open House day?

B: I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing that you need to do is be somewhere else!
A: I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.

B: You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your home?

A: I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.

B: How long have you been in your current home?

A: I have lived in my home for about 10 years.

B: As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year. People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.

A: Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?

B: It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot less.

A: What is the next step in selling my home?

B: I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you and I can figure out a contract.


2
 Repeat

A: I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.

B: I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When 

were you thinking of selling your home?

A: I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the one I now own.

B: Have you owned your home for a long time?

A: I just bought my home two years ago.

B: I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.

A: Will I be losing money if I sell right now?

B: It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.

A: What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?

B: If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can draw up a contract.


3
 Repeat

A: I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.

B: It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you interested in selling in the near future?

A: I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving to Hawaii.

B: Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?

A: The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6 months ago when my mother passed away.

B: Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home, the greater the profit.

A: Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?

B: It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.

A: What should we be doing to get the process started?

B: If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.
A: I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. 

B: To cancel your reservation, I need your name, phone number, and date of trip, please.

A: I can put all of that right on the package and then bring it down to you, if that's okay.

A: I'm checking out in about half an hour.

B: Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.

A: Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun.

B: You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m.

A: Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my bags.

B: Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour. You also need to leave a deposit.

A: My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?

B: Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.

A: Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment.

B: Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.


2
 Repeat

A: I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.

B: I'm ready when you are, sir.

A: Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.

B: You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.

A: I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my luggage?

B: Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.

A: A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?

B: I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely.

A: Let me think about this.

B: Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.


3
 Repeat

A: Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?

B: Just say the word, sir.

A: Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun.

B: I agree. The dew is still on the grass.

A: I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my luggage.

B: We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a deposit.

A: Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?

B: Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.

A: I'll have to think about this for a second.

B: Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.

A: I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure my baggage.

B: We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.

A: A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit.

B: Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.

A: That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute.

B: Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.


5
 Repeat

B: You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.

A: Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?

B: I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card.

A: It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. 

B: Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check out
A: My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never ordered one.

B: Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie "Titanic."

A: That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.

B: Okay, let me see what I can do.

A: Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple.

B: I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the service.

A: Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?

B: Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.

A: This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!

B: I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.


2
 Repeat

A: I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered.

B: Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching "Titanic" Monday night.

A: That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night.

B: Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.

A: Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word.

B: One slight problem, sir. I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from your file.

A: You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?

B: I feel your pain, sir.

A: Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. 

B: I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.


3
 Repeat

A: You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.

B: Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched "Titanic" Monday evening.

A: The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night.

B: Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.

A: I knew you'd see it my way.

B: Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.

A: Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?

B: Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.

A: This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!

B: If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.


4
 Repeat

A: Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?

B: Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching "Titanic."

A: The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night.

B: Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, please.

A: Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.

B: Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service charge.

A: You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!

B: Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.

A: Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!

B: I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.


5
 Repeat

A: I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered.

B: Hmm. Your file shows that you watched "Titanic" Monday night.

A: Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert.

B: Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error, please.

A: Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly.

B: When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.

A: Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake?

B: Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.

A: Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?

B: Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not
A: I am checking out. Here is the key to my room.

B: Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, and then you're free to go. Here you go!

B: I'm glad you enjoyed the city, anyway. But please don't think too unkindly of us.


4
 Repeat

A: I'm out of here. Here's my key.

B: Give me just a few seconds, sir, and I'll hand you your receipt. Here you are.

A: I thank you.

5
 Repeat

A: My stay is over. Here's the key to my room.

B: Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir.

A: This visit is over for me. Here's your room key.

B: Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt.

A: I need to get a taxi.

B: We have a variety of transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi?

A: No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi.

B: Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel.

A: Just a taxi, please.

B: And what is your destination?

A: I'm going to Rockefeller Center.

B: I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?

A: I want to leave as soon as possible.

A: Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo.

B: A taxi it is, sir.


3
 Repeat

A: Can you get me a taxi?

B: We offer various types of transportation. Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle?

A: Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine.

B: In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style.

A: No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers.

B: Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?

A: My destination is Rockefeller Center.

B: What time do you want to leave the hotel?

A: As soon as possible.

B: I'll call the taxi immediately, sir.

A: I'm coming downstairs now.

B: A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir.


4
 Repeat

A: I'm going to need a taxi.

B: You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private vehicle.

A: A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay.

B: Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi.

A: No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo.

B: No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?

A: I'm headed to Rockefeller Center.

B: When shall I tell the taxi to be here?

A: Right now.

B: The taxi will be here immediately, sir.

A: Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute.

B: You won't have to wait a second, sir.


5
 Repeat

A: I need a taxi.

B: We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer.

A: No, the taxi will do.

B: Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine.

A: No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine.

B: No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?

A: I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center.

B: What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?

A: I'm ready to go right now.

B: I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.

A: Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs.

B: You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.


6
 Repeat

A: Could you please reserve a taxi for me?

B: Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?

A: A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one.

B: Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?

A: T A X I, please.

B: A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? 

A: Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?

B: A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir.

A: Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs.

B: The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
A: Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?

B: We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations.

A: What exactly does that mean?

B: Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.

A: That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?

B: If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.

A: Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?

B: To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7:00 a.m. till 10:00 p.m. 

A: I'll go down there as soon as I can!

B: I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.


2
 Repeat

A: Does this hotel have a pool?

B: I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim stations.

A: I'm not sure I understand.

B: Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.

A: Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?

B: Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.

A: Excellent! Now what are the hours?

B: The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only.

A: I'm going to change into my trunks right now!

B: I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.


3
 Repeat

A: Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?

B: We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.

A: I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?

B: It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.

A: Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?

B: As a guest, sir, you pay nothing.

A: This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?

B: If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. 

A: Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!

B: I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim stations.


4
 Repeat

A: I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here.

B: This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.

A: Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?

B: You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.

A: All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?

B: The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.

A: Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?

B: They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week.

A: Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!

B: The swim stations are very popular, sir. I hope you don't find a line down there.


5
 Repeat

A: I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet.

B: We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.

A: Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?

B: You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the same thing.

A: Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?

B: The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.

A: Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?

B: The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

B: Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.


3
 Repeat

A: My minibar is empty.

B: You already finished off everything, sir?

A: I finished off everything.

B: Would you like anything in particular?

A: The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each.

B: Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?

A: I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please.

A: I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop.

B: Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you the payment options. 

A: I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service.

B: That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them.

A: Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives.

B: We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.

A: Very good. How much does that cost?

B: The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per page.

A: I see. And the other alternatives?

B: Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here.

A: Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?

B: You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.


2
 Repeat

A: I need broadband for my computer.

B: No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good to go.

A: That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only.

A: Go ahead. I'm all ears.

B: We have a computer lab on the first floor.

A: That's great! How much is it?

B: It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course.

A: What about the other alternatives?

B: You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.

A: Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?

B: Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.


3
 Repeat

A: I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.

B: There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop.

A: I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.

B: That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.

A: Any alternative that works will be great.

B: Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.

A: That sounds good. What's the charge?

B: The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print.

A: That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?

B: Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here.

A: Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something there?

B: They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the lab.


4
 Repeat

A: I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup.

B: Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and running.

A: That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses wireless only.

B: In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives.

A: Anything to get me up and running.

B: For starters, we have a computer lab.

A: Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?

B: The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing.

A: That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives.

B: Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless right here.

A: Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?

B: Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.


5
 Repeat

A: How do I get online with my laptop?

B: Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a heartbeat.

B: No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.

A: Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. 

B: Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.

A: Great! But is it free?

B: Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee.

A: You said there were other alternatives?

B: Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.

A: That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the lobby?

B: We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to the lab
A: I need a doctor immediately!

B: Sir, is everything all right?

A: My wife just collapsed on the floor!

B: Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911.

A: Time is critical. Hurry up!

B: No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab.

5
 Repeat

B: Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. 

A: That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests?

A: I need some to keep as souvenirs!

A: I need souvenirs!

B: You want some souvenirs!

A: Yes, yes. Souvenirs.

3
 Repeat

A: How do I get more amenities?

B: I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.

B: Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.

B: Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?

A: No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day.

B: I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?

A: I need to take home some souvenirs!

B: Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!

A: Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection.

B: If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has everything.

A: Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?

B: No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.


5
 Repeat

A: I need some more amenities, please.

B: I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.

B: Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?

A: No, I'm not even halfway through my supply.

B: I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?

A: What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?

A: There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs.

B: Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items.

A: I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start now.

B: Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily

B: We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no.


5
 Repeat

A: Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?

B: Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory.

A: So, where do I go to exercise?

B: It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs.

A: Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?

B: Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key.

A: Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?

A: Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court.

B: Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.


4
 Repeat

A: This room is unacceptable. I want a new one, and I want a refund for tonight.

B: Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?

A: I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!

 Repeat

A: I have a little problem with room 507.

B: Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem.

A: I'd like to order dinner.

B: What would you like?

A: I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do.

B: And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?

A: Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne will do for tonight.

B: Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? 

A: Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries.

A: I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan.

B: Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?

A: My date's very sophisticated, so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best.

B: May I suggest our own hotel restaurant? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review.

A: No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?

B: There's always Gramercy Tavern. They have live jazz. The food is delicious, but very expensive.

A: That sounds like a good place to take a date. Can you make a reservation for me?

B: As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there.


2
 Repeat

A: Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?

B: Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?

A: My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best.

B: Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating.

A: That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else, maybe?

B: Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with great food and music.

A: That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?

B: Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.


3
 Repeat

A: So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a restaurant.

B: I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?

A: She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her.

B: Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.

A: I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another restaurant?

B: The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated. It has great food and live jazz, but it's not cheap.

A: Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a table?

B: I'm already dialing, sir.


4
 Repeat

A: I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good one?

B: But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?

A: She deserves nothing but the best, of course.

B: In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food, and the service are outstanding.

A: I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another one in mind?

B: You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its expensive entrees. 

A: Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please reserve a table for me.

B: Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.


5
 Repeat

A: I'm taking my date to a restaurant. Could you tell me about one or two good ones?

B: My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?

A: She will want an excellent restaurant, of course.

B: You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris. The service and food are world-class.

A: I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here. Do you know of another good restaurant?

B: You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern. It's famous for its food, service, and live jazz.

A: I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?

B: At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you.


6
 Repeat

A: Well, I've got a date. Now I need to find a restaurant. Can you help me? 

B: No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady?

A: Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!

B: Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here. This hotel has a three-star restaurant.

A: I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have another suggestion?

B: Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, they have live jazz.

A: Gramercy Tavern? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a table, okay?

B: Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge
A: The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice.

B: Of course. I'd be more than happy to help. I am, after all, the hotel's concierge.

A: Concierge? What exactly is that?

B: We advise you on where to visit, eat, or shop during your stay here in New York.

A: Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?

B: The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin.

A: I saw the Statue of Liberty on my last visit here. Can you recommend somewhere else?

B: Hmm. What type of interests do you have?

A: In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running.

B: Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?

A: No, but I've heard a lot about both.

B: Well, Central Park is wonderful for running. Afterwards, you should head to the Museum to enjoy the art.

A: Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot.

B: I'm sure you'll have a good time there.


2
 Repeat

A: I was told to see you about going sightseeing.

B: It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service.

A: Concierge? Could you explain that to me?

B: We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop.

A: Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?

B: I would suggest the Statue of Liberty.

A: Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?

B: Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?

A: I really like to run. And I like art.

B: Well, there you go! Have you ever visited either Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?

A: No, but I've been meaning to.

B: Well, Central Park is fantastic for running. Then you can go to the Museum to look at the beautiful art.

A: That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that.

B: Enjoy your run and your visit!


3
 Repeat

A: I need some sightseeing advice.

B: That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me.

A: I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?

B: A concierge helps visitors like you find great places to visit, shop, and eat.

A: That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?

B: I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty.

A: You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?

B: Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time.

A: When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums.

B: Well, have you ever been to either Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?

A: No, but I sure would like to.

B: Central Park is great for just about everything outdoors. Then you can visit the Museum of Modern Art.

A: Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today.

B: Enjoy the views at both places.


4
 Repeat

A: I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first.

B: I'm only too happy to help. Tourists should always check with their concierge first.

A: Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word.

B: A concierge directs visitors to the city's great tourist, shopping, and eating places.

A: That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?

B: Well, if you're like most people, you'll want to go to the Statue of Liberty.

A: I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else.

B: Sure! Tell me about your interests.

A: I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters.

B: You'll get along fabulously at Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either?

A: No, I just haven't had the opportunity.

B: You'll love Central Park for running. Later on, you can go to the Museum of Modern Art.

A: Thank you. That's what I'll do.

B: This might be the best day of your visit.


5
 Repeat

A: I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you.

B: As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir.

A: Concierge? Are we speaking English here?

B: A concierge helps you find all the great places for visiting, shopping, and eating.

A: What would you suggest that I visit first?

B: How about starting at the Statue of Liberty? Many people like to begin there.

A: The last time I was here, I visited the Statue. So do you have another place in mind?

B: I think so. Tell me what interests you.

A: I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running.

B: Then you must go to Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you been to either one?

A: No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them.

B: Both places are usually crowded with natives and tourists. You'll love the Park and the Museum.

A: Thank you. That's great advice.

B: This might be the best day of your visit.


6
 Repeat

A: Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? 

B: Your concierge, sir, is the right person to ask when you need sightseeing advice.

A: What in the world is a concierge?

B: We direct visitors to all the great tourist, shopping, and eating spots in the city.

A: Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?

B: Definitely the Statue of Liberty. I think that that is everyone's favorite first stop. 

A: Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?

B: I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?

A: I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums.

B: Well, the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park were made for you! Have you gone to either one?

A: No, although I've heard great things about both of them.

B: You don't want to miss either place. Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art are big and beautiful.

A: Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here.

B: This is a day you're going to remember for a long time
A: I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.

A: On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of 7:15.

B: Said, and done. Will there be anything else?

A: No, that gets it for now, thank you.

B: Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.


4
 Repeat

A: Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.

B: Not a problem. What time shall we call you?

B: It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.

A: Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?

B: No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?

A: No, that's about it for now.

B: Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.


5
 Repeat

A: I need a wake-up call tomorrow.

B: What time would you like your wake-up call?

B: That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7:00, and another at 7:15.

A: Then again, I think 7:15 is too early. Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.

B: So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30. Do you have any other requests?

A: Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.

B: Okay, sir. Sleep well.


6
 Repeat

B: Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.

B: Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15. 

A: Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it. Change it to 7:30.

B: The second call is now changed to 7:30. Is there anything else we can help you with?

A: Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll call you.

B: We're here all night long if you need anything

B: You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country. Things are a little more desperate here than you are used to.

A: Can I walk around and see the sights at night?

 Repeat

A: I would like to purchase some health insurance. 

B: Have you ever purchased health insurance before?

A: I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.

B: Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?

A: Could you explain the difference to me?

B: To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor.

A: When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?

B: The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like. 

A: How much will an HMO cost me per month?

B: Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote.

A: I am calling to purchase health insurance.

B: Do you have health insurance now?

A: I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.

B: You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?

A: I don't know what I want.

B: Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors.

A: When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?

B: The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.

A: How much will a PPO cost me per month?

B: We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire.


3
 Repeat

A: I need information on purchasing health insurance.

B: Is this the first time you have had health insurance?

A: This is my first time buying health insurance.

B: You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?

A: I am not sure what those are.

B: Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.

A: If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?

B: By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.

A: Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?

B: We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.

A: If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?

B: You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website.

A: What if I just show up there?

B: The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone.

A: What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?

B: That is not a good way to go. You could be left waiting for many hours and there is no guarantee that they will see you at all!

A: What about going to the DMV on Saturday?

B: For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore.

A: I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion.

B: You should check out the Automobile Club. I think you would enjoy being a member.

6. How to Pay for the Used Car

1
 Repeat 

A: I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing it.

B: I can help you. Do you have a down payment?

A: Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.

B: Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car.

A: I don't know where exactly to get a loan.

B: Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.

A: What is the best choice for financing?

B: It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.

A: What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?

B: You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good luck!


2
 Repeat 

A: Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?

B: I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down payment.

A: Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment.

B: That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a down payment.

A: I am not sure who will loan money to me.

B: You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends.

A: Who offers the best interest rate?

B: A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer will almost always give you some type of loan.

A: Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?

B: Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will have a few days to produce proof of insurance. Enjoy your new car!


3
 Repeat 

A: I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am thinking of buying.

B: I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment?

A: I will be getting money from selling my old car.

B: You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you the rest of the money that you need. 

A: Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?

B: Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a car lot, they might use the dealer finance company.

A: What is the best place to get financing?

B: The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are your only choice if you are just starting out.

A: Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?

B: Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You can then work on getting insured. Enjoy your new car!

A: If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a major accident.

B: Yes, you can check the history of the car online. Next, we need to turn on the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses.

A: Will you take a drive with me to check handling?

B: A test drive would be good. But first let's make sure that the turn signals, radio, lights, and seats work properly.

A: On a test drive, what should I look for?

B: Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been repaired and also check tire wear.

A: If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded online.

B: Right. All major accidents should have been recorded. Next start the car up, pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses.

A: I would like for you to take a test drive with me.

B: We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn signals, and all of the lights work properly.

A: As we drive, what am I checking for?

B: You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop.

A: I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the help.

B: This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!

 Repeat

A: Do you want some dessert?

A: Where is our waitress anyway?

B: Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?

A: I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.

B: Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.

A: So the bill is $36.00.

B: How much do you think we should leave for a tip?

A: My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.

B: I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.

A: Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.

B: I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.


2
 Repeat

A: Would you like some more coffee?

B: No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.

B: The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?

A: I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.

B: Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.

A: So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.

B: How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?

A: I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.

B: I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.

A: I think that we should leave 10%.

B: $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.


3
 Repeat

A: Would you like to order anything else?

B: No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.

A: Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?

B: I think that is our waitress over by the bar. Boy, the service has not been good this evening.

A: She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.

B: Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together.

A: Our total for dinner is $36.00.

B: What do you think would be the right amount to tip?

A: I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.

B: I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.

A: I believe that 10% is just about right.

B: I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.

A: John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year.

B: I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark.

A: What are you talking about?

B: What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?

A: You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us!

B: Really? Who made that rule up?

A: With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here.

B: That works for me!

A: John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year.

B: I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.

A: You can't be serious!

A: After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.

B: Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case.

A: You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to you at all!

B: Whatever you say!

A: We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together.

B: I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you would like to tell me about?

A: Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move in with him as well!

B: I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!
